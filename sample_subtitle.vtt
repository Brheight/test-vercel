00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Welcome to our 30-minute yoga practice!

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Let's begin in a comfortable seated position, with our hands on our knees and our eyes closed.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, allow your body to release any tension.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Now, let's start to move our bodies. Inhale, and reach your arms up overhead.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
As you exhale, fold forward, bringing your hands to the ground in front of you.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Keep breathing deeply as you move through this flow, allowing your body to relax and release.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Next, let's come into downward-facing dog. Push your hips up and back, and press your heels down towards the ground.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Take a few deep breaths in this position, feeling the stretch in your legs and spine.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Now, let's come into tree pose. Bring your right foot to rest on your left inner thigh, and balance on your left foot.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Place your hands in prayer position at your heart, and breathe deeply.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Switch sides, bringing your left foot to your right inner thigh.

00:00:55.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Continue to flow through these poses, and feel free to modify or adjust as needed to make this practice work for you.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:05.000
And that's the end of our 30-minute yoga practice. Thank you for joining us!
